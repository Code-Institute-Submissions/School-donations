# School Donations

The aim for this project is to create an interactive data visualisation using a dataset from DonorsChoose.org (United States–based nonprofit organization that allows individuals to donate directly to public school classroom projects. Founded in 2000 by former public school teacher Charles Best, DonorsChoose.org was among the first civic crowdfunding platforms of its kind. The organization has been given Charity Navigator’s highest rating every year since 2005).

This Data visualisation represents school donations accross the United States over a certain time period.
